Test Cases for Database

1. Check if correct data is getting saved in the database upon successful URL push (putResult)
2. Check values for columns which are not accepting null values.
3. Check for data integrity. Data should be stored in single or multiple tables based on the design.
4. Database tables and fields should have a primary key & foreign key.
5. Database names should correlate with variable names in Web UI and Command in Control.

7. Check numeric fields with minimum, maximum, and float values.
8. Check numeric fields with negative values (for both acceptance and non-acceptance).
9. Check if the database fields are designed with the correct data type and data length.
10. Null values should not be allowed for the Primary key column.
